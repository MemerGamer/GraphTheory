# Graph Theory Algorithms

This repository contains C++ and Python implementations of various graph theory algorithms. These algorithms are commonly taught in university courses and can be used to solve a variety of problems related to graphs.

## List of Algorithms

- [x] Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- [x] Depth-First Search (DFS)
- [x] Prufer Encode & Decode
- [ ] Cutting Nodes and Edges in Graphs
- [ ] Bridges, Local Bridges and Almost Local Bridges in Graph Theory
- [x] Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
- [x] Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm
- [x] Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
- [x] Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- [x] Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
- [ ] Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

## Getting Started

To use these algorithms, you'll need to have a basic understanding of graph theory and programming in either C++ or Python.
Each algorithm is contained in its own folder and the corresponding files and can be run independently.

## Prerequisites

To run the C++ implementations, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. The code has been tested with g++ on Linux. To run the Python implementations, you'll need Python 3 installed.

## Installing

To use these algorithms, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```console
git clone https://github.com/MemerGamer/GraphTheory.git
```

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own folder and file and can be run independently.
To use an algorithm, simply navigate to the corresponding folder and files and run it using the appropriate command for your language.

There are also tests for each algorithm, these are automatically run if you run the main.cpp file in the root directory for C++ or the main.py file in the root directory for Python.
